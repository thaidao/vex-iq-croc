**Croc's story**
My 3-year-old daughter's teacher invited me to attend the career talk in her kindergarten.
She asked me to bring something to show them what exactly I did in recent years for pre-schooled kids.
It was a really challenging question for me. Then I built a robot in a crocodile shape and wrote a simple program in a single day.
I transformed the original VEX IQ Alligator by replacing her legs with the 250mm wheels from the competition add-on kit.
She had been equipped with 1 distance sensor and 4 Touched LED
This Croc is able to interact with kids by making random sounds after finding out the object in front of her.
Additionally, she can change her body color if a kid touches her mouth.
On event day, the kid was excited and amazed by Croc, while I had to say nothing more about my job :dancers:
